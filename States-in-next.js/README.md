In Next.js (and React), state, props, and the component lifecycle are fundamental concepts that help in building interactive and dynamic UIs. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:

1. State in React/Next.js
State refers to data that can change over time within a component.
It is managed locally within the component and can trigger re-rendering when the data changes.
In functional components, we use the useState hook to manage state.
Example:



`import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}`





In this example, count is the state variable, and setCount is the function to update the state. Every time the button is clicked, the state is updated, and the component re-renders to show the new value.
